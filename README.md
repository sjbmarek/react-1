# Korean Alphabet Click

### Overview

This app is a memory game with React. This project required breaking up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. It's made by following up the instruction below: 

1. Thisis a React application.

2. The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

3. The application tracks the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once.

4. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

5. After an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
